# numberGuessingGame()

I took Hackbright Academy's coding challenge as part of the application for its [software engineering fellowship](https://hackbrightacademy.com/courses/fellowship/) (a 10-week coding bootcamp for women). This challenge is intended for a non-technical beginner like me to show she can independently learn enough of a new programming language (functions, arrays, loops, operators, etc.) to write a working game. I used Javascript so I could practice in the browser and on my phone. It took me several hours but I really enjoyed it and learned a lot.

#### The challenge
> Write a **function** that is a number guessing game. It should determine a random number from 1-100, and let the user guess the number. It should report back whether their guess is correct, too high, or too low. Important: if the user guesses a number they've already guessed, it should tell them they have previously guessed this number. Until they guess the correct number, it should continue to prompt them. Once they've guessed the correct number, it should congratulate them and tell them how many guesses they took to solve the problem (minus any duplicate guesses). Thanks for playing!

**NB:** this is just a single Javascript function, not an app or a website, so that fiddle.jshell.net pop-up alert *is* the game.
Also you have to have Javascript enabled duh.

If you're reading this, feel free to fork. I'd love feedback and to see alternative solutions, especially in different languages.
